    <h1>Charles Bridge</h1>
    <p>The Charles Bridge is a gothic structure built during the medieval times in Prague. It crosses the Vltava River and was the most important connection between the Prague Castle and the city's Old Town. The bridge is not built for cars to cross, so artists and musicians can be found playing along its edges.</p>
